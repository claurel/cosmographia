/** A ParticleEmitter generates particles at a uniform rate over some
 *  specified time interval.
 *  
 *  Once the particle systems properties are initialized, particles are
 *  generated by calling the generateParticles() method with the current
 *  simulation time. The particle system described by a ParticleEmitter
 *  object is stateless: no state is maintained between calls to
 *  generateParticles. This keeps memory usage to a minimum, and more
 *  significantly that particles systems can be 'run' at any rate,
 *  even backwards.
 *
 *  The initial particle states are controlled by an InitialStateGenerator
 *  object. Various subclasses of InitialStateGenerator produce useful
 *  distributions of particle positions and velocities. In addition the
 *  emitter has a velocity variation parameter that can be adjusted to
 *  introduce an additional random factor for the velocity. Particle motions
 *  over time may be modified by a constant force vector. Setting the force
 *  to a non-zero vector will cause the particles to follow parabolic paths.
 *
 *  Particles also have properties that are purely dependent on the time
 *  elapsed since the particle was emitted, a value referred to as the
 *  age of the particle. Age-dependent properties are the size, color,
 *  and opacity. Particle size is linearly interpolated between the
 *  start and end valus over the lifetime of the particle. Color and
 *  opacity are computed by interpolating values in a small lookup
 *  table that can be modified with the setColor() method.
 *
 *  Examples:
 *
 *  A sphere of particles emerging from the origin. The velocity of the
 *  generator is zero, and it is solely the velocity variation factor
 *  that is reponsible for setting the particles on their paths:
 *  \code
 *  emitter->setGenerator(new PointGenerator(Vector3f::Zero(), Vector3f::Zero()));
 *  emitter->setVelocityVariation(1.0f);
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  Adding an initial velocity for the generator will produce a cone of
 *  particles:
 *  \code
 *  emitter->setGenerator(new PointGenerator(Vector3f::Zero(), Vector3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)));
 *  emitter->setVelocityVariation(0.5f);
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  Adding a force will turn the cone into a particle fountain:
 *  \code
 *  emitter->setForce(Vector3f(0.0f, 0.0f, -0.3f));
 *  \endcode
