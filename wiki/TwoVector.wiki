#summary TwoVector frames in catalog files

= Introduction =

The coordinate axes of a two-vector frame are determined by a primary and secondary direction vectors. The vectors must both be non-zero and they must not be exactly aligned.

= Direction Vectors =

The direction vectors may be one of three types:
  * RelativePosition
  * RelativeVelocity
  * ConstantVector
